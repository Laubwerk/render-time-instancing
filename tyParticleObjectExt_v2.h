tyParticleObjectExt (v2) CHANGELOG:

09/07/2021:

* interface now encapsulated in "tyFlow" namespace
* multiple tyParticleObjectExtXXX classes now consolidated into single class
* STL dependency removed. std::vector<T> changed to tyVector<T> (defined below), and some 
virtual functions have "Vec" suffix to avoid naming collisions with legacy tyParticleInterface
* CollectInstances/CollectInstanceNodes consolidated into single CollectInstances function,
where differentiation between Mesh/INode pointers is now done in tyInstanceInfo class 
in coordination with the bits set in tyInstanceInfo::flags
* "dataFlags" argument of CollectInstances now used to specify the type of data to collect.
* "plugin" argument of UpdateTyParticles/CollectInstances now TSTR instead of enum
* tm0/tm1 of tyInstance struct replaced with tyVector<Matrix3>, as a future-proof way
of potentially supporting multi-segment motion blur (more than two transforms for a single
motion blur interval query)
* further information about these changes are listed in the relevant comments below
* interface query macros replaced with proper functions

*/

	The tyParticleInterface interface allows you to access

		//UpdateParticles because it will clear out some data cached 
		//by UpdateTyParticles.
		
		tyObj->UpdateTyParticles(node, t);
		
		//To ensure maximum data access speed, we convert our channel
		//strings into channel indices outside of the particle loop 

		//Channel strings are arbitrary and defined by the user inside
		//the tyFlow's various operators. Safety checks are in place to
		//ensure attempts to access a missing channel will not cause
		//any errors. A default value for missing channels will simply
		//be returned instead (0.0f, Point3::Origin, Matrix3(1))

		//Note: channel names are case-sensitive

	built-in Tab<T> dynamic array class has its own limitations which can lead to program
	instability (its assignment operator doesn't properly copy values, so if you append
